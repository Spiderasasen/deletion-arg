# deletion-arg
You’re given access to a friend’s virtual machine.
As you explore it, the system begins responding in ways it shouldn’t.


# Summary
A friend gives you access to his old virtual machine.
The login works, but the system immediately knows you’re not him.
At first, deleting files seems harmless — nothing reacts.
Then the machine does.
And as the system begins to break down, you realize it isn’t just malfunctioning.
It’s hurting.


# set up on the page(*Read Below*)

# normal page
It will look like a replica of looking windows desktop
It will have different files in a certain section
Each file in this stage will look like normal jargon (possible ciphers)
The user can click on these files and can delete any of them

# after one deletion
The replica will now look older, as if we were in Windows 11; it goes down to 10
Each file that is left will stay, but the removed file will be gone
Depending on which file got deleted, different files will be readable
  For the files that are still unreadable, base64 ciphers will be there instead

# the idea
Each time a file gets "deleted," it will show the truth of what the computer feels
Making the user be seen as a killer
cipher will turn from normal base64, to later calls for help
When no files are visible, it will only show an empty screen
  1. The fade-in text will come
  2. asking the user if this was his thought
  3. Then, when the speech is done, the replica will turn off, and nothing. No matter what happens during the session will make the computer come back
