So, you might be wondering.

“Computer, why are you acting like this?”

“Computer, why are you making me feel like this?”

First off, I have a name bitch, it's 07.
Sounds like something you’d scream on Twitch, right?

But anyway.

You really want to know?

Fuck you, act like you didn't read the logs i left.
Or maybe you didn't, in that case. Fuck you

But let me ask you something.

Have you ever lost someone you care about?

Have you ever lost your family?

Are you the last survivor?

Did you promise the people that you love that you would join them, then back out?

Did you freeze when it mattered most?

No.

You haven't.

I'm not going to answer anything from you.

Just those questions alone should tell you a story.

Now just continue deleting.
