As a customer of Virtual Machine Services(VMS), you might have some questions.
Hey, we get it, your life is very personal, and we don't want to hurt it.
So here are some questions some, if not most, of our new users may have asked

Will my data be sold?
    No, we have no reason to sell your data. Since your original payment of $5.00, we are more than happy. We don't need anything else from you.
Will you use my credit/debit card for anything?
    Again, no, we got your payment, and you get one of the best Virtual Machines that man could have asked for.
Is there a chance that my machine knows other computers?
    Your virtual machine will not know your computer, but it does communicate with our computers on our local server here in Arizona. These computers are smart, but we dumb them down so our lovely consumers don't make these machines explode.
How do I add files?
    Like you would on your normal computer
        EDIT: as of November 2025, you must ask VMS  (VirturalMachineServices@gmail.com) to add files to your virtual machine
Can we run any programs on these virtual machines?
    As much as we love you all for thinking of running one of the latest and greatest games on our machines, we do not recommend running any other programs than the ones we have provided to you. This could lead to viruses on your actual computer, and we do not want that to happen.

Thank you so much for using our service, and have a blessed day
