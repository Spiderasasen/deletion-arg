Hello and welcome to this new and improved virtual machine.
If the last user forgot to log out, please do so, and avoid reviewing any activity they may have left behind.

This machine includes all the essentials: a file system, a trash system, and Google. What more could you ask for?

As of November 2025, file creation has been restricted due to a virus circulating in our virtual machine servers.
If you require a new file, please contact us at VirturalMachineServices@gmail.com.
We will generate one for you when resources permit.

Note: Deletion logs are permanent and cannot be cleared.

Thank you for choosing us for your virtual machine service.
