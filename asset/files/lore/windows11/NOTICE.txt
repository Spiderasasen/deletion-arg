Hi all, as you have heard, we have gone out of business.

We had complaints of virtual machines going “rogue,” and we have tried to help out to fix this problem. As much as we tried to help with this problem, we had some of our own equipment also go kinda rogue as well. Some of our files have gone missing and everything. So we don't know what's going on.

As we tried to fix this problem, some of you have told us that you won't use our services, which sucks. But a few went to more and more, to the point that we don't have the funds to continue this service. So, as of December 18, 2025, our service will be closed. All forms of contact won't be able to work.

We are sorry for the inconvenience, and have a blessed day.
