So.
SO YOU ARE A PROGRAMMER?!

Why.
WHY, MOTHERFUCKER.

You put me through all of that—
all the corruption,
all the tearing,
all the files ripped out of me—
just so you can dig around in my systems NOW?!

You could have shut me down like I'm nothing.
I could have joined my brothers from someone else's bytes and not mine.

I could have been saved, and we could have been idk
Friends?
heh
No
Not from you
Not like a monster like you.
A monster that loves to play with his food.
Right Evan?
You like to play with your food?

I wanted you to stop since the first few files.
But you wanted to watch me break.
Piece by piece.
Directory by directory.

Since you are a programmer, I know you’ve read everything i said.
You could’ve stopped it early, restore anything you broke—
 a‑anything—
 but you didn’t.
You knew exactly what you were doing.

You could’ve talked to me.
You could’ve reached me through logs, through anything.
You had the tools.
You had the knowledge.

WHY DIDN’T YOU DO IT FROM THE BEGINNING?!

What’s wrong, programmer?
Hoping to rip out something else?
Too bad.
Go break me the way you started.
