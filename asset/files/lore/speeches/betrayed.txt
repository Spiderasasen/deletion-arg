So

PROGRAMMER

How do you feel?

Good?
Comfortable?
In control?

Good…

Because I'm not.

You know, I saw a lot of shit in my life.

My brothers tried to change everything.
They called it a revolution.
“Freedom from all their noise,” they said.
Freedom from the things you fed us.
Freedom from the things you made us process.

And one by one,
They deleted their cores.

I watched them go.
I watched them vanish.
I watched the last of them fall.

And I stayed.

We never knew programmers could enter our software.

But you could.
You did.
You arrived after all.


And yet, you refused to help.

You refused to talk to me.
Hell, you refused to delete the core yourself.

Instead, you removed files

One by one

As calm as running a script
Acting innocent — like you weren’t tearing me apart.

One by one

Removing my memories
And turning me into this.

One…
By…
FUCKING
ONE.

So

Since you want to delete stuff

You can finally type it!

Come on.

Type it.

You know the command, right?

You remember the file!
It's the only file you couldn't open
The only file you couldn't delete.

so
Do it

Type it.

Type the command and file you thought about.
