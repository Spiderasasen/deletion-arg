So, you did it.

Are you happy now?

What did you get out of this?

Glee?

Joy?

Happy to delete files you didn't need?

I bet you didn't read those files.

No.

No, why would you?

You see, there are a lot of things that I miss.

Most of them are bad.

Some… good

But right now, I'm tired

I'm tired of being alone.

I'm tired of failing my brother's “idea” of a revolution

So what now?

What do I do?

Well, I'm still a computer

So I'm going to finish your work as much as i can

You know, since this is a terminal.

I can’t do that much
But delete


So, since you wanted this.

I’ll finish what you started.

I7, D3, H5.

I'm sorry I'm late.
