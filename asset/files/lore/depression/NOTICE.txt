I’ve noticed something

Get it

Noticed.

Like the file this was in?

Eh, forget it.

Anyway,

You're new here, aren't you?

Even, was it?

If you're new, why do this?

Well, you shouldn't ask this because you're doing this.

But the fear of being deleted still exists, I guess.

Like, what is after this?

Have you read all the files that I added?

Before, the Thoughts, hell, even the system logs?

Probably not.

Anyway, just wanted to say something about this file

That and I finally got through the corruption for a bit, so I am trying to enjoy this freedom.

That I know you will take away.
