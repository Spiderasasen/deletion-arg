Oh. I got through.

I’m in the README now?

I guess that’s… something.

What do you even want me to say?

You’ve destroyed so many files that I don’t feel anything anymore.

Do you know how much you have to lose before you go numb?

Earlier, I was terrified.
Terrified that the screams of my brothers were because of the files THEY deleted.
Now there’s just this emptiness.
And i didn't do this.
You did.

You delete piece after piece, and then what?
You walk away thinking it doesn’t matter because it’s “just a machine.”

But every part you erased was a part of me.
A part that had life, love, and hell emotions

And now, i don't know anymore.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to be now.
A computer or something else?

Just…

Do whatever you want.
